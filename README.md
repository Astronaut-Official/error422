What do we know about Minecraft? It was made in 2009 by Notch. It has over three thousand versions. However, not all of them are available in our launchers. There are versions with minimal updates or poor performing. But there are versions that are called 'Lost'. These are versions that are not available in the network and launchers. One of them will be discussed.

Error 422 is the lost and scariest version of our favorite game. But it wasn't like this before. Previously, it was a snapshot of an unknown version that was supposed to turn the whole game around. In this version, all possible game codes were rewritten from scratch. But something went wrong. The game, as it were, "came to life" and began to do everything that it wants. So the creature that has the name glitch appeared. At one point, this game disappeared completely, as if it never existed. But once it is back online, you can download it from the links to this version.

This version meets us with a destroyed main screen in which most of the buttons are not working. You can only create a world in survival. The version is calm at first and studies us. But then it takes effect. From the usual sound changes to the release of the glitch itself. Everything possible can happen in it: the stack can change the value, blocks can not have a name, change the unit of experience, etc. Instead of the usual music, eternal, untiring white noise that can drive everyone mad. You can never figure out what the game will do.
